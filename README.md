# Card with animation

A small front-end project that demonstrates a stylized card layout using HTML and CSS, including hover animations and responsive typography.

This project focuses on creating a clean, visually appealing card with a gradient footer, hover effects, and proper typography using Google Fonts.

## Purpose

This project was built to:
* Practice CSS layout and box styling.
* Experiment with hover animations and transitions.
* Work with gradients, shadows, and rounded corners.
* Apply clean typography with Google Fonts.

## Features
* Card with top content and footer section.
* Hover effect rotates the card back to straight and scales the profile photo.
* Gradient footer with a name and circular profile photo.
* Box shadows and rounded corners for a polished look.
* Responsive typography using rem units.

## Tech Stack

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Google Fonts

## How It Works

The card is structured using a <div> with content and a <footer> for the name and photo.

CSS handles all styling:
* Rounded corners (border-radius)
* Shadows (box-shadow)
* Hover effects (transform + transition)
* Gradient footer (linear-gradient)

Google Fonts are used for typography to create a clean, modern look.

Hovering the card triggers the card rotation to straighten and enlarges the profile photo slightly.

## Styling Notes

* transform and transition create smooth hover animations
* Box shadow and gradient add depth and visual interest
* Typography is set in rem units for consistency and responsiveness
* Circular profile image achieved with border-radius: 100%
